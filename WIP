Currently, most of the time, RSpec runs correctly for all tests.  Just occasionally, its like it got off on the wrong foot.
Suspect some sort of async behaviour that makes it fail if a thread change happens at the wrong time.  Will require more work.
It does also seem to be either the same tests fail or pass.

RSpec is unable to run individual tests from within Rubymine.
RSpec is unable to run failed tests on their own.

We still have an issue where sometimes specs fail that normally work.  Some sort of race condition in the code.

Rake task for Yard.
