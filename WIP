Currently, most of the time, RSpec runs correctly for all tests.  Just occasionally, its like it got off on the wrong foot.
Suspect some sort of async behaviour that makes it fail if a thread change happens at the wrong time.  Will require more work.
It does also seem to be either the same tests fail or pass.

conditions_to_evaluate is destryong cfsms_still_in_play in traffic light problem.
