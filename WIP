Main focus has been so far on the condition parser.  So far, I am able to parse some very simple expressions such as "a.b ==  6 or a.c > 6".

Got it now so that on a simple expression we can run RSpec and evaluate the parse tree.  Working on the OR and AND versions next.

Parsing fairly complex expressions.  Need to expand tests to cover more cases.
