Currently, most of the time, RSpec runs correctly for all tests.  Just occasionally, its like it got off on the wrong foot.
Suspect some sort of async behaviour that makes it fail if a thread change happens at the wrong time.  Will require more work.
It does also seem to be either the same tests fail or pass.  This is still a problem after latest rework to eliminate the
problem.

We need to make CFSM spelling consistent throughout.  We have examples of cfsm, CFMS and Cfsm.  Should all be either
CFSM for types, or cfsm for files, variables and methods.

We still have an issue where sometimes specs fail that normally work.  Some sort of race condition in the code.

Rake task for Yard.
